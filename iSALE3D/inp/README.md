The inp files named with asteroid-().inp are used for high-resolution simulations and generating dump files for regridding.  
asteroid.inp -- high-resolution simulation  
asteroid-0102.inp -- generate dump files at T=0.1 and 0.2  
asteroid-04.inp -- generate dump files at T=0.4   
The inp files named with restart-().inp are used for regridding simulations at different time points.  
restart-01.inp -- regrid at T=0.1  
restart-02.inp -- regrid at T=0.2  
restart-04.inp -- regrid at T=0.4   
  
s-asteroid.inp and s-restart-c.inp are used for mini model simulations
