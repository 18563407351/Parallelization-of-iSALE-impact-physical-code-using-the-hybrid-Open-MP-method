# Parallelisation of the iSALE shock physics code using a hybrid OpenMP/MPI approach  
iSALE( impact Simplified Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian) is a multi-material, multi-rheology
shock physics hydrocode, which was based on a numerical fluid-dynamics computing
technique SALE.  
https://isale-code.github.io/  
This project aims to design a regridding function for iSALE3D that can
coarsen the resolution by a factor of two.
